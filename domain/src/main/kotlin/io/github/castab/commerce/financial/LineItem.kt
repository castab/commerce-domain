/**
 * One immutable commercial line on a [FinancialDocument].
 *
 * The [id] is supplied by the application and identifies the line within its document, so
 * that a [ChangeOrder] can replace or remove it. It must be unique within one document.
 *
 * ## Quantity semantics
 *
 * - When [quantity] is present, [price] is a unit price and the line [subtotal] is
 *   `price × quantity` (for example 4 × 25.00 = 100.00).
 * - When [quantity] is `null`, the line is flat-priced: a service fee, labor, or another
 *   offering that is not counted in units. The line [subtotal] is [price] itself.
 *
 * ## Tax
 *
 * [price] never includes tax. [taxAmount] is the final tax attributable to the whole line,
 * already calculated by the application. It is not a rate, and it is not the taxable
 * amount. The line [total] is `subtotal + taxAmount`.
 *
 * [price] and [taxAmount] must be in the same currency, which is the line's [currency].
 *
 * The library does not constrain signs: negative prices, quantities, or tax amounts can
 * express discounts, returns, or credits when an application needs them.
 *
 * Being a data class, a line item can be revised with `copy(...)`. The copy is validated
 * like any other line item. Use [ChangeOrder.Change.ReplaceLineItem] to put the revision
 * on a document.
 *
 * @property description Short description of what is being charged for. Must not be blank.
 * @property subDescription Optional secondary text, such as details or notes.
