/**
 * The type-level booking lifecycle protocol.
 *
 * This hierarchy defines the phases of a booking lifecycle and, through the transition
 * functions declared on each phase, the legal edges between them:
 *
 * ```text
 * InitialRequest ──toQuote()──► Quote ──toBooking()──► Booked ──complete()──► Completed
 *        │                        │                      │
 *        └──cancel()──────────────┴──cancel()────────────┴──cancel()────────► Cancelled
 * ```
 *
 * A lifecycle may begin at either [Active.InitialRequest] or [Active.Quote]. There is no
 * library-owned factory or initial value: a lifecycle begins when an application
 * constructs a model that implements one of those two phases.
 *
 * ## Application models inhabit phases
 *
 * Consuming applications do not store a lifecycle value inside their models. Their
 * domain types implement a phase interface directly:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * data class CateringQuote(
 *     val customerId: CustomerId,
 *     val total: BigDecimal,
 * ) : BookingLifecycle.Active.Quote {
 *     override fun toBooking(): CateringBooking = CateringBooking(customerId, total)
 *     override fun cancel(): DeclinedCateringQuote = DeclinedCateringQuote(customerId)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `CateringQuote` does not *contain* the `Quote` phase. It *is* a concrete application
 * representation of the `Quote` phase. Advancing the lifecycle means transforming one
 * lifecycle-typed application model into another, not mutating a state field.
 *
 * ## Edges, not policies
 *
 * Transition functions represent legal lifecycle edges, not the business prerequisites
 * necessary to traverse those edges. The library defines what may legally follow a phase.
 * The implementing application defines whether, when, and how the transition occurs,
 * and what data the next phase contains. Every transition function is abstract.
 *
 * Illegal edges are absent from the API rather than rejected at runtime. For example,
 * [Active.InitialRequest] declares no `complete()`, and [Terminal] phases declare no
 * transitions at all.
 *
 * Implementations may narrow each transition's return type to their own concrete type
 * (for example, `override fun toBooking(): CateringBooking`). Callers holding the concrete
 * type then receive concrete types back without casts.
 *
 * ## Sealed taxonomy, open phases
 *
 * [BookingLifecycle], [Active], and [Terminal] are sealed. The lifecycle taxonomy is closed,
 * and `when` expressions over a [BookingLifecycle] or an [Active] are exhaustive without an
 * `else` branch. The five phase interfaces are deliberately *not* sealed, so types in
 * any module can implement them.
 *
 * ## Intentional limits
 *
 * The protocol provides the canonical lifecycle API. It does not control all application
 * code. An application can still construct a terminal model directly, and nothing in the
 * type system stops a single class from implementing more than one phase. Phases are
 * intended to be mutually exclusive, and each concrete application type should implement
 * exactly one of them.
