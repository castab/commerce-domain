/**
 * One immutable snapshot of a commercial document: an [Estimate], a [Quote], or an
 * [Invoice].
 *
 * ## Lineage and versions
 *
 * Every snapshot belongs to a lineage identified by [id]. A lineage starts at
 * [Version.INITIAL] with no [previousVersion]. Nothing ever modifies a snapshot. Every
 * commercial modification ([changeOrder]) and every lifecycle transition
 * ([Estimate.toQuote], [Quote.toInvoice]) returns a *new* snapshot with the same [id], the
 * next [version], and a [previousVersion] equal to the source's version:
 *
 * ```text
 * ABC v1 Estimate ─changeOrder→ ABC v2 Estimate ─toQuote→ ABC v3 Quote
 *                 ─changeOrder→ ABC v4 Quote    ─toInvoice→ ABC v5 Invoice
 * ```
 *
 * The stage may change along a lineage. The [id] and [customerId] never do.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle stage
 *
 * The stage is the sealed subtype itself. There is no mutable stage or type property, and
 * `when` over a [FinancialDocument] is exhaustive without an `else` branch. The legal
 * transitions are exactly the functions each stage declares:
 *
 * ```text
 * Estimate ─toQuote()──→ Quote ─toInvoice()──→ Invoice
 * ```
 *
 * A lineage may *begin* at any stage: [Estimate.create], [Quote.create], and
 * [Invoice.create] are all first-class entry points. Once a lineage exists it moves only
 * forward, one stage at a time. There is no `Estimate → Invoice` shortcut and no reverse
 * transition.
 *
 * ## Derived totals
 *
 * A document holds at least one [LineItem], and all of its line items share one
 * [currency]. [subtotal], [taxAmount], and [total] are always calculated from the line
 * items and can never be supplied by a caller, so a document cannot contradict its own
 * lines.
 *
 * ## Customer relationship
 *
 * Every snapshot identifies the customer through [customerId], without copying name,
 * email, phone, or booking location. A change order or stage transition preserves this
 * reference. Payment and refund facts remain outside the document.
 *
 * ## History and persistence
 *
 * A snapshot refers to its predecessor only through [previousVersion] (or
 * [previousReference]); it never embeds earlier snapshots. Loading one snapshot therefore
 * never loads its history. A persisted lineage is naturally one row or document per
 * snapshot, keyed by `(id, version)`. Earlier snapshots are retrieved on request through an
 * application-supplied [FinancialDocumentHistory].
 *
 * This library does not coordinate concurrent writers. Two processes holding the same
 * snapshot can each compute a legitimate successor with the same version. The persistence
 * layer must reject the second write, typically with a uniqueness constraint or an
 * optimistic-concurrency check on `(id, version)`.
 *
 * ## Settlement is outside the document
 *
 * A financial document describes what is being charged and how that description evolved.
 * It does not describe settlement and holds no settlement state: no amount paid, balance,
 * payment status, payments, or refunds. Settlement is a separate bounded context that
 * references documents, never the reverse. This library models it in
 * `io.github.castab.commerce.payment`, where payment allocations reference a document
 * snapshot by its [reference] and balances are derived, never stored. Applications still
 * own persistence, processor integration, and payment policy.
