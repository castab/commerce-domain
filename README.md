# commerce

[![CI](https://github.com/castab/commerce/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/castab/commerce/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Kotlin/JVM commerce toolkit for building service businesses: catering, mobile auto
detailing, computer repair, pet and service appointments, general point of sale, and the
next ones. It has two independently consumable modules:

```text
commerce
│
├── commerce-domain        (Gradle project :domain)
│
│   Reusable commerce vocabulary and invariants.
│   Depends on kotlin-stdlib only. Can be consumed independently.
│
└── commerce-runtime       (Gradle project :runtime)
    Opinionated runtime/application machinery used
    to construct concrete commerce applications:
    http4k on Jetty, PostgreSQL through HikariCP, JDBI, and Flyway,
    kotlinx.serialization, Hoplite configuration, explicit composition.
    Depends on commerce-domain. A library, not an application.
```

| Artifact | Coordinates | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| commerce-domain | `io.github.castab:commerce-domain:<version>` | [domain/README.md](domain/README.md) |
| commerce-runtime | `io.github.castab:commerce-runtime:<version>` | [runtime/README.md](runtime/README.md) |

> **Requires Java 25.** Both artifacts are compiled to Java 25 bytecode, tested on Java 25,
> and require a Java 25 or newer runtime.

## Three layers, two modules

```text
commerce-domain                  (this repository)
      │
      ▼
commerce-runtime                 (this repository)
      │
      ▼
concrete commerce application    (the consuming project)
```

1. **Domain.** `commerce-domain` holds the reusable concepts, facts, invariants, and
   protocols: customers, bookings and the booking lifecycle, estimates, quotes, and
   invoices, payments, allocations, refunds, reconciliation, the provider-neutral payment
   adapter contract, and principals, roles, and permissions. It knows nothing about HTTP,
   databases, serialization, or frameworks.
2. **Runtime.** `commerce-runtime` is the opinionated, reusable machinery from which a
   commerce application is assembled: operations, transactions, PostgreSQL persistence,
   HTTP on http4k and Jetty, errors, health, the configuration model and its loader,
   commerce repositories and routes, and application contribution points. It is a
   library. It is not itself an application, and it provides no default application and
   no `main()`. It defines the configuration it requires but ships no `application.conf`,
   and it emits logs but ships no logging configuration.
3. **Concrete application.** The consuming project, for example Fiona's catering
   application or a detailing, repair, pet salon, or point-of-sale application. It
   depends on `commerce-runtime` and supplies its business-specific behavior and details
   through explicit `ApplicationContributions`. It owns `main()` and its process
   lifecycle, its deployment configuration (`application.conf` and environment), and its
   logging configuration (`logback.xml`), and it creates and starts the runtime.

The module dependency points one way: `:runtime` → `:domain`, never the reverse. The build
enforces it. `:domain`'s `check` fails if its runtime classpath ever contains anything
beyond `kotlin-stdlib`.

## Intended usage

```text
Catering Application           Detailing Application          POS Application
  (owns main())                  (owns main())                  (owns main())
        │                              │                              │
        ▼                              ▼                              ▼
commerce-runtime               commerce-runtime               commerce-runtime
        │                              │                              │
        ▼                              ▼                              ▼
commerce-domain                commerce-domain                commerce-domain

Payment adapter (e.g. a future stripe-adapter)
        │
        ▼
commerce-domain
```

Each concrete application composes the runtime in its own entry point:

```kotlin
// In the catering (or detailing, or POS) application's own project.
fun main() {
    val runtime =
        commerceRuntime(
            configuration = CommerceRuntimeConfiguration.load(),
            application =
                ApplicationContributions(
                    migrationLocations = listOf("classpath:db/migration"),
                    routes = { context -> cateringRoutes(context) },
                ),
        )

    runtime.start()

    // The application owns its process lifecycle from here.
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(Thread { runtime.close() })
    Thread.currentThread().join()
}
```

- **An adapter** that only needs the shared vocabulary, such as the provider-neutral
  payment contract, depends on `commerce-domain` alone. It never picks up
  `commerce-runtime`, http4k, Jetty, JDBI, HikariCP, PostgreSQL, Flyway, or Hoplite.
- **An application** depends on `commerce-runtime`, writes its own `main`, and calls
  `commerceRuntime(configuration, application)` with its explicit contributions. It does
  not fork or copy the runtime. The runtime has no default application, so even an
  application with nothing to add passes `ApplicationContributions()` deliberately.
- **Booking is optional.** Booking is one commerce capability, not the root of commerce. A
  point-of-sale application uses customers, invoices, payments, allocations, refunds, and
  reconciliation without ever creating a booking.

`commerce-runtime` does **not** define `CateringBooking`, `DetailingBooking`,
`RepairBooking`, `GroomingBooking`, or any other business-specific booking model. Neither
module will. Those types belong to the applications that need them. The next design step
is a strongly typed, compile-time **booking extension seam** that lets each application
supply its own booking details while reusing the generic machinery. See
[runtime/README.md](runtime/README.md#booking-extension-direction).

## Installation

Releases are published to **GitHub Packages**:

| | |
|---|---|
| Repository | `https://maven.pkg.github.com/castab/commerce` |
| Versions | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/castab/commerce/releases). Both artifacts share one version: a release tagged `v0.1.0` publishes `commerce-domain:0.1.0` and `commerce-runtime:0.1.0`. |

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/castab/commerce")
        credentials {
            username = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.user").orNull ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
            password = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.key").orNull ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        }
        content {
            includeGroup("io.github.castab")
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Either the domain alone (for example, in a payment adapter)...
    implementation("io.github.castab:commerce-domain:0.1.0")
    // ...or the runtime (in a concrete application), which brings the same version of
    // commerce-domain with it.
    implementation("io.github.castab:commerce-runtime:0.1.0")
}
```

GitHub Packages requires authentication even to download public packages. See
[Authentication](domain/README.md#authentication-is-required-even-for-public-packages).

To build against an unreleased checkout, include it as a composite build. Gradle matches
included projects by project name (`domain`, `runtime`), not by artifactId, so map the
coordinates explicitly:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts of the consuming build
includeBuild("../commerce") {
    dependencySubstitution {
        substitute(module("io.github.castab:commerce-domain")).using(project(":domain"))
        substitute(module("io.github.castab:commerce-runtime")).using(project(":runtime"))
    }
}
```

```

The domain lives in `io.github.castab.commerce.*` (booking, customer, financial, payment,
staff), and the runtime lives in `io.github.castab.commerce.runtime.*`. There is no
executable module in this repository: concrete applications live in their own projects.

## Requirements

| | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Java | **25** | Hard requirement for building, testing, and running both modules. Toolchain auto-download is disabled, so a missing JDK 25 fails the build. |
| Kotlin | 2.4.20 | |
| Gradle | 9.7.0 | Pinned through the wrapper (with checksum): the newest Gradle that Kotlin 2.4.20 declares full support for. |
| Docker | any recent | Only for `:runtime` tests, which start a throwaway PostgreSQL 18 container. Not needed to build or test `:domain`. |

Versions are declared in [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

## Building and testing

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean build
```

`build` compiles both modules, runs every test suite and the ktlint checks, verifies the
domain's dependency boundary, and assembles the main, sources, and javadoc jars of both
artifacts. It publishes nothing and needs no GitHub credentials. Local builds use the
version `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Module-specific commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew :domain:build` | Builds and tests `commerce-domain` alone. No Docker, no database. |
| `./gradlew :runtime:test` | Runs the runtime specs against real PostgreSQL (see below). |
| `./gradlew ktlintCheck` | Checks Kotlin sources and Gradle Kotlin scripts of every project. |
| `./gradlew ktlintFormat` | Formats them. |
| `./gradlew :domain:dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath` | Shows that the domain resolves `kotlin-stdlib` only. |

**Runtime tests and PostgreSQL.** The first `:runtime` test run starts a
`postgres:18-alpine` container through the plain Docker CLI, then removes it when the build
ends, even if tests fail. Each database spec creates its own database and applies the real
Flyway migrations. There is no H2, no Testcontainers, and no separate test schema. To use
an existing PostgreSQL server instead, set `TEST_DATABASE_JDBC_URL`,
`TEST_DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `TEST_DATABASE_PASSWORD` (the user must be allowed to
`CREATE DATABASE`).

**Formatting.** One formatter covers the whole repository: the
[ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin 14.2.0 with the root
`.editorconfig` (ktlint official style, four-space indentation). `compileKotlin` formats
main sources first; in `build`, lint checks run before that formatting.

The build cache is enabled. To force tests to run again, add `--no-build-cache` (or use
`--rerun`).

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on Java 25 (Temurin) for every pull
request and every push to `main`. Its steps are ktlint, domain tests, runtime tests, and
then the full build.

## Releasing

A GitHub Release is the only point where versions are published, and one release
publishes both artifacts at the same version.

1. Merge the desired changes to `main` and confirm CI is green.
2. Create a GitHub Release with a new tag of the form `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example
   `v0.1.0`. Prerelease suffixes such as `v0.2.0-alpha.1` are also accepted.
3. Publishing the release triggers the [Publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish.yml).
   It validates the tag and runs `./gradlew clean build` on Java 25.
4. If every check passes, the workflow publishes `commerce-domain` and `commerce-runtime`
   at the version without the `v` to GitHub Packages. The published `commerce-runtime`
   POM depends on `commerce-domain` at that same version. If the tag is malformed or any
   check fails, nothing is published.

The workflow rejects tags that don't match the format: `0.0.1` (no `v`), `v0.1`,
`v01.0.0`, build metadata such as `v1.0.0+build.5`, and `SNAPSHOT` versions. No release
version is ever written into source-controlled files.

**Published versions are immutable.** Never try to overwrite a published version. If
`0.1.0` has a problem, fix it and release `0.1.1`. If a Publish run fails before uploading
anything, use **Re-run jobs** on that run.
